# Leading Beyond Boundaries

During the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2024, the MIT Media Lab, Camera Culture Group, and MIT Connection Science, will kick off "Leading Beyond Boundaries" in Davos. 

Recognizing that disciplinary disconnects can hinder effective technology policy, research, and innovation, Leading Beyond Boundaries seeks to bridge these gaps. Leading Beyond Boundaries aims to bring together a diverse group of leaders across disciplines to foster in-depth  iscussions around the key ideas, challenges, and open questions. Our focus is on addressing pressing societal issues in  areas such as healthcare, privacy, and generative AI.
